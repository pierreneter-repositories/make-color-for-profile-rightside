> This repo with help me make a commit form 1970. So... rightside in your profile will be very long

I try my best to make my profile site longer than ever.
And... but it's make i have a first commit from 1970. Lol.
Ofcourse. I have a commit from 1970, so... i have a The longest rightside.

It's so funny. Lol. :laughing:

## You can do it
* First, just `star` this repo. :kissing_heart:
* And `folk` it.
* `git clone your folk for your self`
* edit file `try` with any content.
* Run
```
git add .
git commit -am "Try my best" --date="1970-01-01 00:00:00"
git push origin master
```
* And then, you have a rightbar like me.. :cupid:
